This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and trying to store a value that is not a string. AsyncStorage only supports storing strings.  Attempting to store other data types (like objects or numbers) will result in this error.  The error message might not be very clear, and often debugging can be challenging because it might not directly pinpoint the offending line of code.
